# IoT-Camp
Camp Assignment for bridging Internet of Things to Cloud Technology

# Dear Parents/Guardians

Participating in a project-based environment where they learned a variety of valuable skills. Below is a brief list and description of what campers will learn:

1. **Working with Hardware using a Raspberry Pi**  
Students learned to connect and control components like sensors and LEDs, gaining hands-on experience with electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT).

2. **Using nano, the text editor**  
Students used *nano*, a terminal-based text editor, to create and edit scripts directly on the Raspberry Pi. This introduced them to working efficiently in a command-line environment.

3. **Programming with Python**  
Students learned the basics of Python, a powerful programming language. They wrote Python scripts to control hardware and process data, building a solid foundation in coding.

4. **Using pip**  
Students became familiar with pip, a tool for installing and managing Python packages. This skill enabled them to enhance their projects with additional features and functionalities.

5. **Web Development with Flask**  
Students installed Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and created a web server and webpage that handles user interactions. This introduced them to web development and demonstrated how services and data can be accessed online—a key concept in cloud computing.

6. **Secure Access with SSH**  
Students learned to securely access devices on a network using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and configured services on a Raspberry Pi for remote management and email alerts.

7. **Data Collection and Display**  
Students collected environmental data and displayed it on a web page, learning about data collection, storage, and visualization—important IT skills.

8. **Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking**  
As they worked on their projects, students encountered challenges requiring creative solutions, helping them develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

By hosting content on a web server, students gained a better understanding of how cloud-based applications deliver data and functionality to users anywhere.

We believe these skills will continue to develop in the future. By combining coding, electronics, web development, cloud services, and IoT in a fun and engaging way, our vision is to inspire future innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs. We hope to see their creativity and skills flourish!
