    <h1>Dear Parents/Guardians</h1>
    <p>We are happy to share that your child participated in an innovative project-based class where they learned a variety of valuable skills. Below is a brief list and description of what was learned:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Working with Hardware using a Raspberry Pi:</strong> Students learned to connect and control components like sensors and LEDs, gaining hands-on experience with electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT).</li>
        <li><strong>Programming with Python:</strong> Students learned the basics of Python, a powerful programming language. They wrote Python scripts to control hardware and process data, building a solid foundation in coding.</li>
        <li><strong>Using pip:</strong> Students became familiar with pip, a tool for installing and managing Python packages. This skill enabled them to enhance their projects with additional features and functionalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Development with Flask:</strong> Students installed Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and created a web server and webpage that handles user interactions. This introduced them to web development and demonstrated how services and data can be accessed online—a key concept in cloud computing.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Access with SSH:</strong> Students learned to securely access devices on a network using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and configured services on a Raspberry Pi for remote management and email alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Collection and Display:</strong> Students collected environmental data and displayed it on a web page, learning about data collection, storage, and visualization—important IT skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking:</strong> As they worked on their projects, students encountered challenges requiring creative solutions, helping them develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By hosting content on a web server, students gained a better understanding of how cloud-based applications deliver data and functionality to users anywhere.</p>
    <p>We believe these skills will continue to develop in the future. By combining coding, electronics, web development, cloud services, and IoT in a fun and engaging way, our vision is to inspire future innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs. We hope to see their creativity and skills flourish!</p>
